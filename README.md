TARDIS
===============
A working entity version of the TARDIS for Garry's Mod.

Usage
===============

Use the sonic screwdriver (another addon of mine) to link the TARDIS to your Sonic device.

You may then point at the ground to designate a location for the TARDIS to move to.

Hold right click on the TARDIS or press R to initiate de-materialization.

Installation
===============
1. Put this folder into Steam/Steamapps/(Steam username or 'Common')/garrysmod/garrysmod/addons/
2. Done, enjoy the TARDIS.
